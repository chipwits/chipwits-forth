# ChipWits-FORTH

This repository contains raw disk images from the archives of the original author of
ChipWits, Doug Sharp. The disks contain the original FORTH source code for ChipWits, as well
as other related files.

For the 40th anniversary of ChipWits (which was released the same year as the original
Macintosh), ChipWits, Inc. released the source code for the game to the public. The team
hopes that this will inspire a new generation of programmers to learn about FORTH and
how many games were programmed in the 1980s.

# What is ChipWits?

From the manual:

> ChipWits is a game where you program robots to explore rooms and mazes filled with different
> kinds of objects. As you learn how to make the robots "think" for themselves, you will sharpen
> your problem-solving skills and learn some of the basic principles of computer programming.

ChipWits was originally released in 1984 for the Macintosh, and later ported to the Commodore 64
and Apple II in 1985. It was created by Doug Sharp and Mike Johnston, and has inspired many
programmers and game developers over the years.

# What is FORTH?

FORTH is a stack-based programming language that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s,
especially for 8-bit microcomputers and embedded systems. It is known for its simplicity
and flexibility, and is still used in some applications today.
