# ChipWits Apple II Source Disks

This repository contains Apple II raw disk images from the archives
of the original author of ChipWits, Doug Sharp.

# Disks

Only one disk appears in this archive. The team originally thought it was
a corrupted Commodore 64 disk, but it turned out to be an Apple II disk.

These disks were imaged by John Morris, using Applesauce.


| Disk                         | Notes                                                                   |

| Apple II Preview (Damaged)   | This appears to be a binary release of the Apple II version of ChipWits |


# Future Work

Further work needs to be done:
* compare this disk image to the version of the Apple II disk present on https://chipwits.com/retro-apple2
* reverse engineer the FORTH source code from this disk image
