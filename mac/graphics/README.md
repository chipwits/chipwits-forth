These ChipWit graphic png files were extracted from:
  chipwits-macpaint-files.dsk

The extraction process:
  1. Go to https://infinitemac.org/ and use the 1991 Mac (System 7)
  2. Drag the 'chipwits-macpaint-files.dsk' onto the screen.
     (The MacPaint files can be examined directly IF YOU USE a
      Pre-System 7 Mac, but not in the System-7 for some reason)
  3. Download the 'SuperPaint.sit' file at https://www.macintoshrepository.org/143-superpaint
  4. Drag the 'sit' file (Compressed Stuffit file) onto the System-7 screen
  5. Open up the 'The Outside World' -> 'Download' to find the SuperPaint.sit file.
  6. Double click on the 'SuperPaint.sit' file to unpack SuperPaint
  7. You might have to close the 'Download' window and re-open it to see the SuperPaint folder
  8. Or you could use 'Find' from the 'File' menu to find SuperPaint.
  9. Open the MacPaint files from inside the SuperPaint application
 10. Use 'File' -> 'Export' to export the image as a 'tiff' file
 11. You might want to rename the file a bit, maybe replace 'export' with 'tiff'
 12. Save the tiff file into the 'The Outside World' -> 'Upload' folder.
 13. This should copy it, via your browser, to your local Download directory.
 14. Unzip the downloaded file, which now has a 'zip' suffix.
 15. Use a graphic tool like GIMP or ImageMagick to convert the tiff file to png
 16. I used 'magick foo.tiff foo.png' to convert these images.
 17. I've included the tiffs if you want to produce different graphic files.

 I cannot praise the people at infinitemac.org or macintoshrepository.org
 enough for making these old Macintosh systems or Macintosh applications
 available on the web.  Also the people who are taking these images and
 possibly using them.  Thank You!
